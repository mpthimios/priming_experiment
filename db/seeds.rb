  {title: "$200 Bucks It Is...", description: "A guy goes over to his friend's house, rings the bell, and the wife\r\nanswers.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\n\" Hi, is Tony home?\"\r\n<p>\r\n\" No, he went to the store.\"\r\n<p>\r\n\"Well, you mind if I wait?\"\r\n<p>\r\n\" No, come in.\"\r\n<p>\r\nThey sit down and the friend says \"You know Nora, you have the\r\ngreatest breasts I have ever seen. I'd give you a hundred bucks if I\r\ncould just see one.\"\r\n<p>\r\nNora thinks about this for a second and figures what the hell - a\r\nhundred bucks. She opens her robe and shows one. He promptly thanks her and\r\nthrows a hundred bucks on the table.\r\n<p>\r\nThey sit there a while longer and Chris says\r\n\"They are so beautiful I've got to see the both of them.

  {title: "An Alien Abduction Story", description: "One eerie night in 1976 in rural Maine four friends who had met at art school went on a camping trip. On the second night they noticed a very bright light in the sky and then on the third night, undeterred by the looming threat of alien abduction, they decided to go for a spot of night fishing. Whilst fishing out on the canoe they noticed the same bright light again. One of the men used his flashlight to make an SOS pattern at the mysterious light. This wouldn't prove to be one of his wisest decisions ever, because shortly afterwards the ominous light rapidly expanded and engulfed all four of them like an alien Pac-Man on steroids.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe next thing the men remembered was waking up back at their campsite with absolutely no idea how they got there and what had happened in-between. The fire they had stoked up before they left was now completely burned out and all was left was a pile of ash. If that doesn't scream \"we've been abducted by aliens and inexplicably lost a substantial period of time\" then I don't know what does. But no, the four men thought nothing more of it and finished their camping trip, acting like everything was just fine.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nBut in the weeks that followed, strange things started to happen. Firstly, all four men started to have the same horrific nightmares of being aboard a spaceship with mysterious beings that had long necks and large heads. In each of the nightmares one of the men was being humiliatingly experimented on whilst the other three men helplessly watched, unable to intervene. It was at this point they realised something serious went down during that camping trip. So, disturbed by their dreams, the men later met with a group of UFO specialists who suggested they undergo regressive hypnosis therapy to make all their horrific memories come flooding back. During the sessions all four men revealed remarkably similar memories of being abducted and experimented on.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nBeing artists all four men were able to accurately sketch their abductors as well as the spacecraft. All of the men's sketches were freakishly similar. Following psychiatric examinations the men were all deemed to be mentally stable and they all passed lie-detector tests. The unnerving event has since come to be known as the Allagash Abductions and at the time it reached national primetime news."},
  {title: "Migrant crisis: Migration to Europe explained", description: "The European migrant crisis or European refugee crisis began in 2015, when a rising number of refugees and migrants made the journey to the European Union (EU) to seek asylum, traveling across the Mediterranean Sea or through Southeast Europe. They came from areas such as Western and South Asia, Africa, and the Western Balkans. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the top three nationalities of the over one million Mediterranean Sea arrivals in 2015 were Syrian (49%), Afghan (21%) and Iraqi (8%). Of the refugees and migrants arriving in Europe by sea in 2015, 58% were men, 17% women and 25% children. The number of deaths at sea rose to record levels in April 2015, when five boats carrying almost 2,000 migrants to Europe sank in the Mediterranean Sea, with a combined death toll estimated at more than 1,200 people.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe shipwrecks took place in a context of ongoing conflicts and refugee crises in several Asian and African countries, which increased the total number of forcibly displaced people worldwide at the end of 2014 to almost 60 million, the highest level since World War II. In the first six months of 2015, Greece overtook Italy as the first EU country of arrival, becoming, in the summer 2015, the starting point of a flow of refugees and migrants moving through Balkan countries to northern European countries, mainly Germany and Sweden. Since April 2015, the European Union has struggled to cope with the crisis, increasing funding for border patrol operations in the Mediterranean, devising plans to fight migrant smuggling, launching Operation Sophia and proposing a new quota system to relocate and resettle asylum seekers among EU states and alleviate the burden on countries on the external borders of the Union. Individual countries have at times reintroduced border controls within the Schengen Area, and rifts have emerged between countries willing to accept asylum seekers and others trying to discourage their arrival.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Eurostat, EU member states received over 1.2 million first time asylum applications in 2015, a number more than double that of the previous year. Four states (Germany, Hungary, Sweden, and Austria) received around two-thirds of the EU's asylum applications in 2015, with Hungary, Sweden, and Austria being the top recipients of asylum applications per capita. The main countries of citizenship of asylum seekers, accounting for more than half of the total, were Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq."},
  {title: "A Mysterious Killing on the Upper East Side Unsettles Residents", description: "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"222\" data-total-count=\"222\">While Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson filmed their 94th episode of “Elementary,” the CBS detective series, on the Upper East Side in Manhattan on Friday, a real-life homicide mystery took a new turn just one block away.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"442\" data-total-count=\"664\">The case has stymied New York City police detectives for more than a week now, after a 78-year-old man was found dead in his apartment on the top floor of a prewar apartment building on East 64th Street. The man, Christopher Cooley, was discovered on March 17, seated on a couch, his necktie looped, but not knotted, around his neck, a throw pillow over his face and a broken lamp at his feet, the police said. His hair was matted with blood.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"442\" data-total-count=\"1106\">The police have not yet publicly declared the case a homicide, but in a brief interview on Friday, the city’s chief medical examiner did just that, indicating that a cord of some sort had been used to strangle Mr. Cooley and that the case was not a suicide. “The cause of death is ligature strangulation, and the manner of death, homicide,” the medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, said. She declined to say what was used to kill him.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"156\" data-total-count=\"1262\">The homicide has left many residents anxious at the thought of a killer on the loose and others annoyed at the sudden intrusion of detectives and reporters.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"115\" data-total-count=\"1377\">Some have begun locking their doors, after years of keeping them unlocked and relying on doormen to keep them safe.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"298\" data-total-count=\"1675\">So far, the case has yielded few clues. Mr. Cooley had long lived alone in his 11th-floor apartment. Younger neighbors knew Mr. Cooley, a Yale graduate, as little more than a friendly face in the elevator. He apparently did not regale neighbors with stories, although he clearly had some good ones.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"274\" data-total-count=\"1949\">While living in Venice as a younger man, Mr. Cooley had gotten to know Ezra Pound, the poet who was indicted on a treason charge for his wartime support of Fascist Italy, and even attended the poet’s last birthday party, days before Pound’s death, <a href=\"http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300191424/olga-rudge-ezra-pound\">according to one book</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"106\" data-total-count=\"2055\">Reached by telephone, a sister of Mr. Cooley’s, Clare Cooley Edwards, declined to speak about his death.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"438\" data-total-count=\"2493\">Mr. Cooley’s frequent vacations were one reason his death went unnoticed for some time, a doorman, who gave his name as Alex, said in an interview. By the time he was found, newspapers dating to March 5 had piled up at his door. But Alex, speaking while on a cigarette break, said he and the other doormen had not suspected anything because “Mr. Cooley often vacationed in Europe and didn’t tell the building that he was leaving.”</p><div id=\"story-ad-1\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"309\" data-total-count=\"2802\" id=\"story-continues-1\">The first person to worry about his absence was an out-of-state sister, who called the building after being unable to reach her brother, the police said. At the sister’s request, the building’s superintendent opened Mr. Cooley’s apartment through a back door. The tenant was found dead, the police said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"210\" data-total-count=\"3012\">The superintendent quickly called the police, and officers discovered no signs of a break-in or robbery. The door to Mr. Cooley’s apartment was locked, the police said, and $190 cash was found in his pockets.</p><footer class=\"story-footer story-content\">"},
  {title: "Biography of Pablo Escobar", description: "Pablo Escobar (or Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria) is often referred to as the ‘King of coke’. This Colombian drugs lord is probably the most famous and successful cocaine trafficker in human history. It is said that 80% of all cocaine shipped to the American market in the 70’s and 80’s was supplied by Escobar and his Medellin Cartel. Having a near monopoly on the cocaine business, Escobar earned billions of dollars, which he used to build a personal empire of 400 luxury villas all around the world, private airplanes, his own army and even a private zoo with exotic animals. According to Forbes, he was the 7th richest person in the world in 1989 with a personal fortune of $3 billion USD.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nBefore entering the drugs trade in the early 70’s, Escobar was involved in various other criminal activities, from stealing cars and selling contraband cigarettes to kidnapping. It didn’t take long for him to discover that trafficking cocaine was the fastest path to wealth and power. The proces was simple: He bought the paste of coca leaves in Bolivia and Peru, since the coca in Colombia was of inferior quality at the time. He refined it in Colombia on one of his properties and afterwards he transported it to the US.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nWhenever the authorities got in his way, he always dealt with them in the same way. He called it ‘plata o plomo’ which can be literally translated into ‘money or lead’. The word “lead” in this case is slang for bullets (which are made of lead). When a policeman, politician or judge hindered his activities, he would first try to bribe the person. If this didn’t work, he would order one of his hit men to kill him. It is said that 100’s or maybe 1000’s of honest men and women found their death by crossing the path of Escobar, including 3 Colombian presidential candidates and the Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNotorious and untouchable in his own country, Pablo Escobar soon became America’s number 1 enemy and in 92 the US special forces joined the manhunt for him. They advised and assisted in the training of a Colombian special police force called the Search Bloc. After lots of failed attempts to find and bring down Escobar, the Search Bloc was finally successful on December 2nd, 1993. A Colombian surveillance team was able to track him down in the Medellin neighborhood where the young Escobar grew up. Being surrounded and in the middle of a fire fight, Escobar tried to escape together with his closest bodyguard via the roofs of adjoining houses. Nevertheless, both of them were shot to death by the Colombian police forces during this attempt to escape."}
