	(2, 'Abduction in Quebec', '<p>This story takes place last year in September, 2008 on the very first anniversary of our wedding. This takes place in Quebec, Canada. But before I get into it, let me share a tiny bit of history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first recollection of seeing something unusual, apart from dreams, was when I was a boy of 6 or 7. I had seen at that time, one ominous night looking out my window, a UFO of some sort. It looked like a star in the sky, but was certainly not. It had been about 10 p.m. or so on a summer&#39;s night. It was as &#34;far&#34; away as the stars were and certainly not an airplane. It moved across the sky with a gentle purpose, and something about it felt friendly, as well as superior. To this day, I know indeed what it was, for I have seen these again and still do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for my wife, she and her siblings -- also around the same age in their respective pasts, around 5 to 8 years of age or so -- have all witnessed dealings with phenomena that are quite out of the ordinary in this respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="cb-split"> As per her own tale, she remembers waking up suddenly in the night, and being prompted to leave her room. She says, it could have been 12 midnight or 3 a.m. (she will never know the exact times). She remembers seeing a huge light occupy an entire window in the upper portion of that two-story house, one in which they lived since babies -- a large house in a fairly rural area in Quebec. She left her room, and walked close to the stairs that led down, and stopped. She remembers a warm feeling pass over her being, and she felt that she could fly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the morning, she says she remembered vaguely the details of the top of her house! How could a little girl get on the roof, much less get a bird&#39;s eye view? It was not a sleep-walking adventure, to be sure!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, sharing with you these two respective past incidents, which are as true as any other true story here, I get on our most recent of tales.</p><p>Last year in September, we had spent a weekend in a town named St. Adele to celebrate our first year anniversary as man and wife. St. Adele is a smallish township in Quebec, yet is famous enough as a ski resort. Being the fall, not too many tourists were in town at the time. Why did we choose St. Adele? We do not know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it was the fall and chilly that night, yet nonetheless we decided to go and stand on the balcony of the small bed and breakfast room we occupied. This was perhaps 10 or 11 p.m. by this point. Looking up at the sky, it was cloudy, and I remember being disappointed, for I always love star-gazing. The moon was out too, not full, but was there, hidden behind the clouds. After about a half hour, all the clouds seemed to be drifting off. I was surprised because I remember saying to my wife, &#34;I haven&#39;t seen anything in such a while, it would have been nice to spy out some tiny moving object!&#34; (It had been a while since either of us could remember seeing much of anything.) Still, we saw nothing at all that night, and as it grew more chilly, we decided to go in and get some rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Waking up the next morning, I remembered a dream. I will share it with you exactly as I remember: In a flash, all I can remember is being inside a circular-shaped room, and there are figures standing inside. The room is clean and crisp, I think blueish white, and it had windows or circular portholes of some kind. I am standing, too, and am being faced by these beings, who look like humans, except for the fact that they are dressed in ancient robes -- not modern clothes, not skin-tight spandex or spacesuits, just robes, like something from ancient times. What is more, they are all male as far as I can tell, and all have dark hair and facial hair as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one in the center, and three flanking either side, making a total of seven &#34;men&#34;. The one in the center must have been the leader; in fact, I know he was, for he radiated the most energy, and he gave the impression of being very wise and very holy. Yes, the first thing that comes to mind is Jesus, or someone like him in some way or another. Don&#39;t ask me why, but this is what I felt, and still wonder about. The thing is, all the &#34;men&#34; look at me, but not the one in the center. He is looking down at the floor as if pondering something. I do not recall any words said or felt in my mind whatsoever.</p><p>After that, there is nothing. That is all I can remember. The duration of this episode lasted perhaps 10 or 15 seconds. I told my wife about it, and she thought it was quite interesting, considering a few things we had recently been talking about. Yet my story has one more little twist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following night we are back at home with nothing special happening, only the warm feeling of having spent a nice weekend remaining with us. We go to bed, and all is well. The next morning, we discover a mark on my right temple. There is a thin scar there, a scab, freshly healing from a cut of some kind. The shape of it is an arrow pointing upward. I have a few pictures of this on my cell phone as well as on my digital camera. This story is true to the last word. The &#34;scar&#34; healed normally, and was gone in a few days.</p>', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

In an especially troubling sign, he had left the residence without his medication.\r\n<br/>\r\nSoon after, police said, Latulip suffered a head injury and lost his memory.\r\n<br/>\r\nBut police said he started having flashbacks last month and remembered his real name: Edgar Latulip.\r\n<br/>\r\nHe told a social worker, who discovered that he was a missing person and contacted local authorities.\r\n<br/>\r\nAfter a voluntary DNA exam, police were able to confirm his identity.\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Missing Children’s Network called it “incredible news.”\r\n<br/>\r\n“Edgar’s recovery is the reason why we never give up hope!” said Pina Arcamone, the organization’s director general.\r\n<br/>\r\nPhil Gavin, spokesman for Niagara Regional Police Service, said Latulip is now preparing to reunite with his family.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n“It’s a pretty huge thing to find out you’re someone else,” Gavin told The Washington Post, “so I think he’s taking it slow.”\r\n<br/>\r\n[The tragic case of the boy who was missing for 13 years and didn’t know it]\r\n<br/>\r\nIn 1986, Latulip was a 21-year-old man with a 12-year-old’s mind, according to local news reports and missing persons listings from that time. He was staying in a group home near Kitchener and living at least partly on a disability pension, according to a 2014 series in the Waterloo Region Record.\r\n<br/>\r\nIt was a Tuesday that September when he skipped town.\r\n<br/>\r\nHis mother, identified by local news media as either Silvia or Sylvia Wilson, told the Region Record that she feared her son had been killed and buried.\r\n<br/>\r\n“This is always at the back of my mind,” Wilson told the newspaper in 2014. “Having an answer would mean closure. When Edgar disappeared, I became quite sick. I had to take a leave of absence from work. I was near a nervous breakdown.”\r\n<br/>\r\nLatulip’s missing persons poster showed a young man with wire-frame glasses and a toothy grin — a computerized image to show people what he might look like. It said he had a thin build, a scar above one eyebrow and troubling mental issues.\r\n<br/>\r\nFor years, investigators tried to find him, pushing paper and going door to door — and, later on, republicizing his cold case, along with several others, in hopes of solving the decades-long mysteries.\r\n<br/>\r\nSgt. Richard Dorling, a homicide detective with Waterloo Regional Police, which oversaw the initial investigation in Latulip’s disappearance, began encouraging local media and members of the community to spread the word.\r\n<br/>\r\n“Pass the information on,” Dorling told the Region Record in 2014. “If you see a poster, a picture or an article, post it on Facebook, send it out on Twitter. I’m hoping somewhere out there, someone will remember something.”\r\n<br/>\r\n[A baffling medical puzzle: How a man’s trip to the dentist cost him the ability to form new memories]\r\n<br/>\r\nAuthorities followed a lead in 1993 to nearby Hamilton after someone reported seeing Latulip there, but they never found him, according to the Waterloo Region Record.\r\n<br/>\r\nAt some point, he settled in St. Catharines.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nPolice would not comment this week on Latulip’s life before his disappearance or the accident that caused him to forget it. It’s also unclear what kind of life he built for himself after vanishing — whether he had a job, a home or a family. Authorities also would not reveal his assumed name.\r\n<br/>\r\nBut they did acknowledge that Latulip started working with the Niagara Regional Police Service last month to find out his true identity. Gavin, the police spokesman, said investigators took a DNA sample from Latulip and contacted Waterloo Regional Police Service, which helped them compare it to a sample taken from a family member.\r\n<br/>\r\nAuthorities recently learned it was a match.\r\n<br/>\r\nDuane Gingerich, a Waterloo Regional Police detective on the case, said he was elated.\r\n<br/>\r\n“I had hopes that he was out there somewhere,” he told the Waterloo Region Record. “For us as investigators, this is great, this is awesome. It’s satisfying because most of these cases don’t turn out this way.\r\n<br/>\r\n“You expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time.”\r\n<br/>\r\nThen, police phoned Latulip’s mother, who now lives in Ottawa.\r\n<br/>\r\n“She was excited, happy, overjoyed,” Gavin, the Niagara Regional Police spokesman, told The Post. “After 30 years of not knowing where her son is — knowing that he’s alive, she’s pretty excited about that.”\r\n<br/>\r\nAlana Holtom, a Waterloo Regional Police Service spokeswoman, told The Post that she had spoken with Latulip’s mother Wednesday and learned that the mother and son were working on a plan to reunite.\r\n<br/>\r\n“She said that obviously this has been a worry to her for a long time,” Holtom said.', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
	(5, 'Biography of Pablo Escobar', '<p>Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was a Colombian drug lord and leader of one of the most powerful criminal organizations ever assembled. During the height of his power in the 1980’s, he controlled a vast empire of drugs and murder that covered the globe. He made billions of dollars, ordered the murder of hundreds, if not thousands of people, and ruled over a personal empire of mansions, airplanes, a private zoo and even his own army of soldiers and hardened criminals.</p><h3>Early Years of Pablo Escobar</h3><p>Born on December 1, 1949, into a lower-middle-class family, young Pablo grew up in the Medellín suburb of Envigado. As a young man, he was driven and ambitious, telling friends and family that he wanted to be President of Colombia some day. He got his start as a street criminal: according to legend, he would steal tombstones, sandblast the names off of them, and resell them to crooked Panamanians. Later, he moved up to stealing cars. It was in the 1970’s that he found his path to wealth and power: drugs.</p>\r\n<div id="inArticleVideo" data-defer="onPageLoad"></div>		\r\n				<p class="cb-split"> He would buy coca paste in Bolivia and Peru, refine it, and transport it for sale in the US.</p><h3>Escobar and his Rise to Power</h3><p>In 1975, a local Medellín drug lord named Fabio Restrepo was murdered, reportedly on the orders of Escobar himself. Stepping into the power vacuum, Escobar took over Restrepo’s organization and expanded his operations. Before long, he controlled all crime in Medellín and was responsible for as much as 80% of the <a href="http://archaeology.about.com/od/cterms/qt/Coca.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">cocaine </a>transported into the United States. In 1982, he was elected to Colombia’s Congress. With economic, criminal and political power, Escobar’s rise was complete.</p><h3>“Plata o Plomo”</h3><p>Escobar’s ruthlessness was legendary. His rise was opposed by many honest politicians, judges and policemen, who did not like the growing influence of this street thug. Escobar had a way of dealing with his enemies: he called it “plata o plomo,” literally, silver or lead. Usually, if a politician, judge or policeman got in his way, he would first attempt to bribe them, and if that didn’t work, he would order them killed, occasionally including their family in the hit. The exact number of honest men and women killed by Escobar is unknown, but it definitely goes well into the hundreds and perhaps into the thousands.</p><h3>Pablo Escobar&#39;s Victims</h3><p>Even being important or high-profile did not protect you from Escobar if he wanted you out of the way. He ordered the assassination of presidential candidates and was even rumored to be behind the 1985 attack on the <a data-inlink="ykPCKEwcGiDqxmEPQOw7Cg&#61;&#61;" href="http://americanhistory.about.com/od/judicialbranch/f/first_court.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">Supreme Court</a>, carried out by the 19th of April insurrectionist movement in which several <a data-inlink="7we6Ix9FBwsmHygex5rIUw&#61;&#61;" href="http://americanhistory.about.com/od/judicialbranch/f/number_justices.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">Supreme Court Justices</a> were killed. On November 27, 1989, Escobar’s Medellín cartel planted a bomb on Avianca flight 203, killing 110 people. The target, a presidential candidate, was not actually on board. In addition to these high-profile assassinations, Escobar and his organization were responsible for the deaths of countless magistrates, journalists, policemen and even criminals inside his own organization.</p><h3>Escobar at The Height of Power</h3><p>By the mid- 1980’s, Pablo Escobar was one of the most powerful men in the world. Forbes magazine listed him as the seventh-richest man in the world. His empire included an army of soldiers and criminals, a private zoo, mansions and apartments all over Colombia, private airstrips and planes for drug transport and personal wealth reported to be in the neighborhood of $24 billion. He could order the murder of anyone, anywhere, anytime.</p><h3><a data-inlink="BcHFExN3NTsOr_ZhS9vHxw&#61;&#61;" href="http://classiclit.about.com/od/robinhoodlegend/tp/aatp_robinhood.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4">Was Pablo Escobar Like Robin Hood</a>?</h3><p>Escobar was a brilliant criminal, and he knew that he would be safer if the common people of Medellín loved him. Therefore, he spent millions on parks, schools, stadiums, churches and even housing for the poorest of Medellín’s inhabitants. His strategy worked: Escobar was beloved by the common people, who saw him as a local boy who had done well and was giving back to his community.</p><h3>Escobar&#39;s Personal Life</h3><p>In 1976, he married 15 year old Maria Victoria Henao Vellejo, and they would later have two children, Juan Pablo and Manuela. Escobar was famous for his extramarital affairs, and he tended to prefer underage girls. One of his girlfriends, Virginia Vallejo, went on to become a famous Colombian Television personality. In spite of his affairs, he remained married to María Victoria until his death.</p><h3>Legal Troubles for the Drug Lord</h3><p>Escobar’s first serious run-in with the law was in 1976, when he and some associates were caught returning from a drug run to Ecuador. Escobar ordered the killing of the arresting officers, and the case was soon dropped. Later, at the height of his power, Escobar’s wealth and ruthlessness made it almost impossible for Colombian authorities to bring him to justice. Every time any attempt was made to limit his power, those responsible were bribed, killed, or otherwise neutralized. Pressure was mounting, however, from the United States government, which wanted Escobar extradited to face drug charges. Escobar had to use all of his power and terror to prevent extradition.</p><h3>La Catedral Prison</h3><p>In 1991, due to increasing pressure to extradite Escobar, the Colombian government and Escobar’s lawyers came up with an interesting arrangement: Escobar would turn himself in and serve a five-year jail term. In return, he would build his own prison and would not be extradited to the United States or anywhere else. The prison, La Catedral, was an elegant fortress which featured a Jacuzzi, a waterfall, a full bar and a soccer field. In addition, Escobar had negotiated the right to select his own “guards.” He ran his empire from inside La Catedral, giving orders by telephone. There were no other prisoners in La Catedral. Today, La Catedral is in ruins, hacked to pieces by treasure hunters looking for hidden Escobar loot.</p><h3>Escobar On The Run</h3><p>Everyone knew that Escobar was still running his operation from La Catedral, but in July of 1992, it came out that Escobar had ordered some disloyal underlings brought to his “prison,” where they were tortured and killed. This was too much for even the Colombian government, and plans were made to transfer Escobar to a normal prison. Fearing he could be extradited, Escobar escaped and went into hiding. A massive manhunt was organized, with help from the United States Government. By late 1992, there were two organizations searching for him: the Search Bloc, a special, US-trained Colombian task force, and “Los Pepes,” a shadowy organization of Escobar’s enemies, made up of family members of his victims and financed by Escobar’s main business rival, the Cali Cartel.</p><h3>The End of Pablo Escobar</h3><p>On December 2, 1993, Colombian security forces using US technology located <a data-inlink="sW1ay-TxzLNk34nUCUeRAw&#61;&#61;" href="http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/20thcenturylatinamerica/a/bioescobar_2.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5">Escobar</a> hiding in a home in a middle-class section of Medellín. The Search Bloc moved in, triangulating his position, and attempted to bring him into custody. Escobar fought back, however, and there was a shootout. Escobar was eventually gunned down as he attempted to escape on the rooftop. He had been shot in the torso and leg, but the fatal wound had come through his ear, leading many to believe that he committed suicide, and many others to believe that one of the Colombian policemen had executed him.</p><p>With Escobar gone, the Medellín Cartel quickly lost power to its ruthless rival, the Cali Cartel, which remained dominant until the Colombian government shut it down in the mid 1990’s. Escobar is still remembered by the poor of Medellín as a benefactor. He has been the subject of numerous books, movies and websites, and fascination continues with this master criminal, who once ruled one of the greatest crime empires in history.</p>\r', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');
